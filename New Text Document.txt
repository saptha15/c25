Class 25:

* Add the animation to the bird class.
*In all the classes we are repeating the same lines of codes but in our programming world we have something called DRY(do not repeat ) principle.

*To avoid writing the same code for all the classes, we have a concept of
inheritance in programming
languages.

*To avoid writing the same code for all
the classes, in programming language
we have a concept of a Parent / Base
class and Children / Sub classes.

*Similarly, in programming, a parent
class is called a Base class and the
inherited class i.e., the child is called
a subclass.

*The keyword extends is used by the subclass to inherit the features of Base class.
